## How to Compile and Run the Program using the Command Line:
1. Type in the command line the path of the folder/zip file.
2. Then type into the command line `javac *.java` to compile the java classes.
3. After compiling, run the program by typing into the command line
`java Project1Main datasets/Num8.txt datasets/Num16.txt datasets/Num32.txt datasets/Num64.txt ...`
(followed by Project1Main, list whatever test cases you would like to test).
4. Output will be written into text files organized by the input dataset and sorting algorithm name. Sample output files can be found in the sample_output folder.
